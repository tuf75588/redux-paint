# Redux Painting Application

## Motivation

In an effort to shake some of the rust off with using Redux, I will attempt to build an application
that is a drawing board, similar to MS Paint using a retro Windows XP themed css library,
`xp.css`

The features of this application will be:

- Picking different colors
- Drawing lines/shapes
- Undoing past actions
- File exporting as .png image
